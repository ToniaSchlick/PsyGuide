# View All Flowcharts

When the "Flowcharts" tab is selected on the top navigation bar, the various treatment flowcharts, or "algorithms", are shown in a list.  These flowcharts are copied to a patient when they are moved to that care plan, and as such when changes are made to the flowchart those changes won't be shown on each patient until they are reassigned that care plan.  Additionally, when changes are made to a patient's care plan when viewing a patient, those changes are patient-specific.

# Edit Flowchart

When viewing a flowchart from the "Flowcharts" tab, clicking the flowchart itself will activate the edit window for the flowchart.  Changes can then be made and saved by clicking the "Save" button in the upper right.
