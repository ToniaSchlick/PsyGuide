# Product introduction

## Our App
Our application gives medical professionals guidelines for typical diagnosis and treatment. When a medical professional uses our app, they can log in and create profiles for their patients. Information stored here, instead of the traditional method in stacks of paper, is more persistant and easier to access.

Furthermore, our app can directly give the PHQ-9 questionnaires at will for regular psychological evaluations, keep track of results, and give the recommended diagnosis and treatment each time. Of course, not all patients fit the recommended diagnosis. In these cases, medical professionals are free to choose a different diagnosis or treatment if it does not match the one recommended by our app. To stay up to date with current research, or if doctors want to make personal adjustments to the treatment algorithms, they may make adjustments to flowcharts using draw.io.

By using our app, medical professionals can stay up to date about how best to treat patients without needing to look through their books before each appointment. This saves time that can instead be given to patients.

## Included Features:
- Secure login and storage, protecting patient information in accordance with HIPPA.
- Developers can adjust treatment protocols, so that our app always provides the latest most effective information.
- Easy to use, so that medical professionals can focus their energy on patients.
