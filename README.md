#Our product
Our application gives medical professionals guidelines for typical diagnosis and treatment, and reminders in . When a medical professional downloads our app, they can log in, put in a list of their patient and their details. Storing data here, instead of the traditional method in stacks of paper, is more secure and easier to access. 
Furthermore, our app can directly give the PHQ-9 each appointment, keep track of results, and give the recommended diagnosis and treatment each time. Of course, not all patients fit the normal diagnosis. In cases like this, medical professionals are free to choose a different diagnosis or treatment if it does not match the one recommended by our app. After choosing a treatment option, our app will automatically notify the medical user about relevant treatment information, such as a prescription ending, at the next appointment. By using our app, medical professionals can stay up to date about how best to treat patients without needing to look through their books before each appointment. This saves time that could be dedicated to patients.

Secure login and storage, protecting patient information in accordance with HIPPA.
