    <h1>About PsyGuide</h1>
    <p>PsyGuide is designed to assist psychiatric prescribers through the prescription process.  Our application allows the prescribe to take the PHQ-9 Patient healthcare questionnaire within an easy to use sub-application of the application. The results of the questionnaire are then the plugged into our applications algorithms and produce a detailed road map that the prescriber can follow that is based on the Prescribing Pocket Guide. The Pocket Guide and the PHQ-9 Patient healthcare questionnaire can both be added to updated based on the latest research.
